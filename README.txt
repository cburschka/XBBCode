XBBCode is an addon for the Drupal web framework (http://www.drupal.org/).
If you install it on your Drupal site, it will create a text format 
named "BBCode" that can generate HTML out of user-entered text markup like this:

    This text is [b]bold[/b] and [i]italic[/i].

Activating the "Basic" submodule will add the most commonly available 
markup tags. Beyond that, it is also possible to create new tags
that either generate static output or use PHP code to determine how
the tag is rendered.
