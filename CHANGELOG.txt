2008-01-20 - 0.3.1:

 - Code style of xbbcode module is now conforming to Drupal standards at last.
 - Several globals have been gotten rid of by placing them as statics into designated functions.
   This keeps the global namespace uncluttered while still allowing the caching of such variables.
 - The tags of a filter are now cached better, using static and Drupal's own caching system.
 - A bug in the parsing of arguments was fixed, which unexpectedly converted spaces to &nbsp; and
   also lost values that were surrounded by single quotes.
   
This is the LAST VERSION of xbbcode that marks a JOINT development. After the last commit, the present trunk
was branched for a DRUPAL-5 version. The trunk will now be upgraded to Drupal 6.x compatibility.

2007-07-07 - 0.3:

 - Code-style cleanup everywhere
 - Removed the static XBBCode class as counter to Drupal structure, replaced with _xbbcode_%s functions.
 - Removed a MySQL version incompatibility that messed up a Natural Join
 - Removed a MySQL version incompatibility (and Drupal style incongruence) by replacing BOOLEAN with INT(1)
 - Filter is now cacheable, automatically resets cache on tag changes.

2007-07-06 - 0.2.2:

 - Modules now register their tags on installation
 - highlighter now tries to detect the PEAR libraries on installation
 - XBBCode can now autoclose tags left open at the end of text (optional)
 - XBBCode now works in PHP 4, thanks to the removal of several foreach($a as &$b) constructs

2007-07-01 - 0.2:

 - Refactored most of the module code, fixing the install system in the process
 - Renamed all the modules to conform with standards.
 

2007-02-16 - 0.1.2:

 - Tags can now be weighted. Parsing follows first weight, then text order.
 - The same tag name can be registered by different modules. Conflicts in the tag namespace 
   can be resolved by the admin, on a per-format basis.
 - Unified the infrastructure; *all* tags are now provided by modules. Admin-created tags 
   are provided through this module's own _xbbcode hook.

2007-02-12 - 0.1.1:

 - Fixed a bug that broke self-closing tags.
 - Fixed a bug that caused strings of form "$name" to disappear from dynamically parsed tags.
 - Fixed a bug that added backslashes to quote characters in dynamic tags.
 
 - Added multiple-arguments functionality for static tags.
